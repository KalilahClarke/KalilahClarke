### Hi there 👋
Full Stack Developer here... (Omg I Rhymed 😜 )
Developing my skills one project at a time. Technology is the Future! It effects the ways we communicate, advocate, and educate. Covid-19 highlighted the clear need for society to accelerate technological developments and integrate tech into our daily lives. As a Pursuit Fellow, my goal is to strengthen my problem solving skills and use my knowledge as a Full-Stack Developer to help fill in the gaps in our society too better support Parents, Students, Teachers, Advocators etc. The motto is allowing life to be more Effective and Efficient.
