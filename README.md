Technology is the Future. 
It effects the ways we Communicate, Advocate and Educated. Covid-19 taught that there is a clear need for society to accelerate technologies development and intergate it into our daily lives. As a Pursuit Fellow my Goal is to become a Full-Stack Developer to problem solve and assist in filling the gaps in society to better support Parents, Students, Teachers, Advocators etc. in their daily lives. Allowing life to be more affective and Efficent.
